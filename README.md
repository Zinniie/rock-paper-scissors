# rock-paper-scissors
This is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game(project) with two players i.e CPU vs Player. A task from I4G + Zuri training.

Some of the links that were helpful in doing this task are:-

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors This explains the game 

These resources plus the ones provided by the tutors guided me through the task on creating and coding the game(project); establishing variables, 
assigning a random play to the CPU, loops, etc
